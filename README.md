# Central_Moments_for_Scatter_Characterization
code for the paper "A Statistical Central Moment Approach to Super-Resolved Multiparameter Scatter Characterization"

Each primary file is currently in .ipynb form, while all class files are in .py and in the 'classes' folder. Code was executed in Google Colab. 

"moments_database_creation.ipynb" creates the databases to train on, while "moments_ML.ipynb" executes the machine learning training loop. "moments_crlb.ipynb" caclulates the Cramer-Rao lower bound for each record given the defined signal-to-noise ratio.
